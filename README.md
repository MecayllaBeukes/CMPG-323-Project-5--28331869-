The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network,
placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The
data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualisations built into a report or
dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially
with different levels of access applied. The COI have been advised that a good way to monitor
the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report.
The report will be built in Power BI, as the organisation already has all applicable licensing
agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the
same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. As a
member of the COI development team, you are expected to acquire and practise the necessary
skills to create such a report.

## How to use the report

The user must make sure that they have Power BI for Desktop 

The user selects a filter on the Filtering page based on Category,Zone, Registration date and Device platform. After selecting the filters, when the user navigates to the Device monitorig, Device registration and High-level Metrics pages the data will be filtered. 

# Filtering 
THE FILTERING PAGE contains filters that can be applied across pages and visuals on each page. These filters allows users to filter the reports based on device category, device platform, device zone and device registration date. The user must click on this page in order to see the view below. Once they have clicked the desired data to filter the can navigate to the other pages where data will be filtered.
